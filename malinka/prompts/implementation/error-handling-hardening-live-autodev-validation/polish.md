# Live Autodev Validation Lane — Fixup

Fix only the current slice for `error-handling-hardening-live-autodev-validation`.


Verification artifact must cover
- summarize the automated proof commands that ran and their outcomes

Priorities:
- unblock the active slice's first proof gate — this is the #1 priority
- prefer staying within the named slice and touched surfaces
- if the proof gate fails on pre-existing issues OUTSIDE your surfaces (e.g., linter warnings in unrelated files, missing imports in dependencies), you MUST fix those issues minimally to unblock the gate — do not leave the lane stuck on problems you can solve
- preserve setup constraints before expanding implementation scope
- keep implementation and verification artifacts durable and specific
- do not create or rewrite `.fabro-work/promotion.md` during Fixup; that file is owned by the Review stage
- do not hand-author `.fabro-work/quality.md`; the Quality Gate rewrites it after verification
- ALL ephemeral files (quality.md, promotion.md, verification.md) go in `.fabro-work/`, never the repo root
